Golconda Fort (Telugu: గోల్కొండ, romanized: Gōlkōnḍa) is a historic fortress and ruined city located in Hyderabad, Telangana, India.
It was originally called Manugallu.
The fort was originally built by Kakatiya ruler Pratāparudra in the 11th century out of mud walls.
It was ceded to the Bahmani Kings by Deo Rai, Rajah of Warangal during the reign of Sultan Muhammad Shah (1358-1375 A.D.) of the Bahmani Sultanate.
Following the death of Sultan Mahmood Shah, the Sultanate disintegrated and Sultan Quli, who had been appointed as the Governor of Telangana by the Bahmani Kings, fortified city and made it the capital of the Golconda Sultanate. 
Because of the vicinity of diamond mines, especially Kollur Mine, Golconda flourished as a trade centre of large diamonds known as Golconda Diamonds. Golconda Fort is currently abandoned and in ruins.

The complex was put by UNESCO on its "tentative list" to become a World Heritage Site in 2014, with others in the region, under the name Monuments and Forts of the Deccan Sultanate (despite there being a number of different sultanates).
The Golconda Fort used to have a vault where the famous Koh-i-Noor and Hope diamonds were once stored along with other diamonds.
<br>
Golconda is renowned for the diamonds found on the south-east at Kollur Mine near Kollur, Guntur district, Paritala and Atkur in Krishna district and cut in the city during the Kakatiya reign. 
At that time, India had the only known diamond mines in the world. Golkonda was the market city of the diamond trade, and gems sold there came from a number of mines. 
The fortress-city within the walls was famous for diamond trade
