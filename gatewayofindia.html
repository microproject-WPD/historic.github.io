<br><br>The Gateway of India is an arch monument built during the 20th century in Bombay, India. 
The monument was erected to commemorate the landing of King George V and Queen Mary at Apollo Bunder on their visit to India in 1911.

Built in Indo-Saracenic style, the foundation stone for the Gateway of India was laid on 31 March 1911.
The structure is an arch made of basalt, 26 metres (85 feet) high. 
The final design of George Wittet was sanctioned in 1914 and the construction of the monument was completed in 1924.<br><br> 
The Gateway was later used as a symbolic ceremonial entrance to India for Viceroys and the new Governors of Bombay.  
It served to allow entry and access to India.
<br><br>
With a history of over 100 years, the colossal monument stands overlooking the majestic Arabian Sea, making it a sight to behold. 
The monument has also been referred to as the Taj Mahal of Mumbai, and is the cityâ€™s top tourist attraction.<br><br>
