   The Konark or Konark Sun temple is dedicated to the Hindu sun god Surya, and, conceived as a giant stone chariot with 12 wheels, it is the most famous of the few sun temples built in India. 
It is located about 35 km northeast of the city of Puri on the coastline in the state of Odisha (earlier Orissa). 
It was built in 1250 CE by King Narasimhadeva I (r. 1238-1264 CE) of the Eastern Ganga dynasty (8th century CE - 15th century CE). 
<br><br>The temple in its present state was declared by UNESCO a World Heritage Site in 1984 CE. 
Although many portions are now in ruins, what remains of the temple complex continues to draw not only tourists but also Hindu pilgrims.
 <br><br>Konark stands as a classic example of Hindu temple architecture, complete with a colossal structure, sculptures and artwork on myriad themes.
 The word 'Konark' is a combination of two Sanskrit words kona (corner or angle) and arka (the sun). 
 It thus implies that the main deity was the sun god, and the temple was built in an angular format. 
 The temple follows the Kalinga or Orissa style of architecture, which is a subset of the nagara style of Hindu temple architecture.<br><br>
