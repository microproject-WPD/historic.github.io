Qutab Minar is a soaring, 73 m-high tower of victory, built in 1193 by Qutab-ud-din Aibak immediately after the defeat of Delhi's last Hindu kingdom. 
The tower has five distinct storeys, each marked by a projecting balcony and tapers from a 15 m diameter at the base to just 2.5 m at the top. 
The first three storeys are made of red sandstone; the fourth and fifth storeys are of marble and sandstone. 
At the foot of the tower is the Quwwat-ul-Islam Mosque, the first mosque to be built in India. 
An inscription over its eastern gate provocatively informs that it was built with material obtained from demolishing '27 Hindu temples'. 
A 7 m-high iron pillar stands in the courtyard of the mosque. 
It is said that if you can encircle it with your hands while standing with your back to it your wish will be fulfilled.
<br><br>
The origins of Qutab Minar are shrouded in controversy.
 Some believe it was erected as a tower of victory to signify the beginning of the Muslim rule in India. 
 Others say it served as a minaret to the muezzins to call the faithful to prayer.

No one can, however, dispute that the tower is not only one of the finest monuments in India, but also in the world.
 <br><br>Qutab-ud-din Aibak, the first Muslim ruler of Delhi, commenced the construction of the Qutab Minar in 1200 AD, but could only finish the basement. 
 His successor, Iltutmush, added three more storeys, and in 1368, Firoz Shah Tughlak constructed the fifth and the last storey.<br><br>
